# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Description:
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .

PLAN We first decide which things I need before going to market . Is it a shirt , jeans , footwear etc.
PREPARE Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money.
PROCESS Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers / shoes / sandals etc.
ANALYSE You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of t-shirt you want to buy, will it make a good combination.
SHARE Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you.
ACT Then you finally buy it!<br>
YOUR TASK:<br>
Your task is to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process. You can prepare a PPT/PDF on a real-life scenario explaining it with the above process (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and submit it as part of this task.
